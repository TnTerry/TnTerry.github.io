This paper propose a novel Unified Uncertain Dual-prompts cross-domain Segmentation framework (UUDS) for unsupervised cross-domain medical image segmentation. Specifically, our UUDS forms a unified framework by integrating domain adaptation and segmentation models, facilitating interaction between the two tasks, and addressing the challenge of emphasizing segmentation semantics while domain adaptation. Additionally, UUDS creatively uses dual-prompts, domain and segmentation prompts, to learn domain-invariant feature representation, ensuring that model can learn domain-invariant feature representation from cross-domain space. Furthermore, to facilitate interaction between the two tasks, UUDS uses uncertainty estimation to dynamically compute the label of segmentation for directly supervising the cross-domain adaptation, making the semantic information from unlabeled target images can directly supervise the process of domain adaptation and keeping the model sensitive to segmentation.
