This paper proposed a framework that integrates supervision on textual and visual explanations for more comprehensive and explainable AI reasoning, which enhances the modelsâ€™ understanding of all aspects with multimodal explanations, including saliency maps and textual explanations. The proposed framework further improved the calculation of loss to overcome the challenge of missing visual explanation modalities with a multimodal consistency method.

This paper is in preparation and is expected to be submitted to a conference in the near future.
